# Titanic-project-walkthrough

The Titanic dataset is one of the famous Kaggle Challenge particularly for the beginners. The competition is quite simple where we need to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. Hence, this article will walk you through basic step for the model submission. We’re going to use Jupyter notebook with several data science Python libraries.

Keep in mind that the working with real-world data is not as easy as we see it here. Nonetheless, this article aims to provide basic guidelines which includes step by step in data cleaning and wrangling, data analysis and etc. It also shows how basic knowledge of statistics is essential in conducting the data science project and the role of specific domain knowledge could potentially influence the output.

For ease of reference, I published two articles to walkthrough and explain the steps. You may check it out here:

I appreciate your comments on any improvement.

Thanks!
